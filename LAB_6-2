#LAB 6-2
#
#After copying over the facts files, create a playbook that uses the facts to set up the rest of the environment. Make sure it meets the following requirements:
#
#• Use a variable inclusion file with the name allvars.yaml and set the following variables:
#
#web_root = /var/www/html
#ftp_root = /var/ftp

#• Create a playbook that sets up the file services and the web services. Also ensure the playbook opens the firewalld firewall to provide access to these servers.
#
#• Make sure the webservice provides access to a file index.html, which contains the text “Welcome to the Ansible Web Server.”
#
#• Run the playbook and use ad hoc commands to verify that the services have been started.
