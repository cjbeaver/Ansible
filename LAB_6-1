# LAB 6-1
#
#Configure a playbook that works with custom facts and meets the following requirements:
#
#• Use the project directory chapter6.
#
#• Create an inventory file where ansible1 is member of the host group named file and ansible2 is member of the host group named lamp.
#
#• Create a custom facts file that contains a section named packages and set the following variables:
#
#smb_package = samba
#ftp_package = vsftpd
#db_package = mariadb
#web_package = httpd
#firewall_package = firewalld
#
#• Create another custom facts file that contains a section named services and set the following variables:
#
#smb_service = smbd
#ftp_service = vsftpd
#db_service = mariadb
#web_service = httpd
#firewall_service = firewalld

#• Create a playbook with the name copy_facts.yaml that copies these facts to all managed hosts. In this playbook define a variable remote_dir to specify the directory the fact files should be copied to. Use the variable fact_file to copy the fact files to the appropriate directories.
#• Run the playbook and verify whether it works.
