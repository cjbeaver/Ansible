## Practice working w/ ansible-vault
#
## Can decrypt w/ 3 flags:
#
# --ask-vault-pass
# --vault-id @prompt
# --vault-password-file=/path/to/pw


--- 
- name: create a user w/ vaulted variables
  hosts: all
  vars_files: # (can place here, too) secrets.yaml
    - secrets.yaml  #(4 spaces)
  tasks:
    - name: creating user
      user:
        name: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ pwhash }}"
